.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAfold
reads RNA sequences from stdin, calculates their minimum free energy
(mfe) structure and prints to stdout the mfe structure in bracket
notation and its free energy. If the \-p option was given it also
computes the partition function (pf) and base pairing probability
matrix, and prints the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, the
frequency of the mfe structure in the ensemble, and the ensemble
diversity to stdout. 

It also produces PostScript files with plots of the resulting
secondary structure graph and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix.
The dot plot shows a matrix of squares with area proportional to the
pairing probability in the upper half, and one square for each pair in
the minimum free energy structure in the lower half. For each pair
i\-j with probability p>10E\-6 there is a line of the form
.br 
i  j  sqrt(p)  ubox
.br 
in the PostScript file, so that the pair probabilities can be easily
extracted. 
If the sequence is preceded by a line of the form
.br 
> name
.br 
then the PostScript files "name_ss.ps" and "name_dp.ps" are produced for
the structure and dot plot, respectively. Otherwise the filenames
default to rna.ps and dot.ps. Existing files of the same name will be
overwritten.
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-p
Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in
addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure
only. Prints a coarse representation of the pair probabilities in
form of a pseudo bracket notation, the ensemble free energy, the
frequency of the mfe structure, and the structural diversity.
See the description of pf_fold() and mean_bp_dist() in the RNAlib
documentation for details.
.br 
Note that unless you also specify \-d2 or \-d0, the partition
function and mfe calculations will use a slightly different energy
model. See the discussion of dangling end options below.
.TP 
.B \-p0
Calculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities,
saving about 50% in runtime. Prints the ensemble free energy \-kT ln(Z).
.TP 
.B \-C
Calculate structures subject to constraints. 
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints 
on the structure encoded with the symbols:  
. (no constraint for this base)
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
x (the base is unpaired)
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
> (base i is paired with a base j<i)
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF
folding ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP 
.B \-T\ \fItemp\fP
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of \fItemp\fP C. Default is 37C.
.TP 
.B \-4
Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetra\-loops. Mostly
for testing.
.TP 
.B \-d[0|1|2|3]
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases adjacent to helices in
free ends and multi\-loops: With (\-d1) only unpaired bases can
participate in at most one dangling end, this is the default for mfe
folding but unsupported for the partition function folding. With
\fB\-d2\fP this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for
the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the
default for partition function folding (\-p). \fB\-d\fP or \fB\-d0\fP
ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.br 
With \fB\-d3\fP mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices
in multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial
stacking of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works
only for mfe folding.
.br 
Note that by default (as well as with \-d1 and \-d3) pf and mfe
folding treat dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to
\fB\-p\fR to ensure that both algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP 
.B \-noLP
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). 
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can 
\fBonly\fP occur isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally 
occur as helices of length 1.
.TP 
.B \-noGU
Do not allow GU pairs.
.TP 
.B \-noCloseGU
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices.
.TP 
.B \-e\ \fI1|2\fP
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet,
where A pairs B, C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\-e 1) or AU
(\-e 2) pairs.
.TP 
.B \-P\ \fI<paramfile>\fP
Read energy parameters from \fIparamfile\fP, instead of using the default
parameter set. A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP 
.B \-nsp  \fIpairs\fP
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs. \fIpairs\fP 
is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If a the first 
character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \-nsp \-GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are 
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP 
.B \-S\ \fIscale\fP
In the calculation of the pf use \fIscale\fP*mfe as an estimate for the
ensemble free energy (used to avoid overflows). The default is 1.07,
useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file). 
.TP
.B \-circ
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA molecule. Currently works only
for mfe folding.
