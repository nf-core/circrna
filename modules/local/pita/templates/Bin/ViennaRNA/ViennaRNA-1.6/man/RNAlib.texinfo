@chapter Introduction

The core of the Vienna RNA Package is formed by a collection of routines
for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. These
routines can be accessed through stand-alone programs, such as RNAfold,
RNAdistance etc., which should be sufficient for most users. For those who
wish to develop their own programs we provide a library which can be
linked to your own code.

This document describes the library and will be primarily useful to
programmers. However, it also contains details about the implementation
that may be of interest to advanced users. The stand-alone programs are
described in separate man pages.  The latest version of the package
including source code and html versions of the documentation can be found

@section Minimum free Energy Folding
The library provides a fast dynamic programming minimum free energy
folding algorithm as described by @cite{Zuker & Stiegler (1981)}.
Associated functions are:


@deftypefun float fold (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure})
folds the @var{sequence} and returns the minimum free energy in kcal/mol;
the mfe structure in bracket notation (@pxref{notations}) is returned in
@var{structure}. Sufficient space for string of the same length as
@var{sequence} must be allocated for @var{structure} before calling
@code{fold()}. If @code{fold_constrained} (@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables})
is 1, the @var{structure} string is interpreted on input as a list of
constraints for the folding. The characters `` | x < > `` mark bases that
are paired, unpaired, paired upstream, or downstream, respectively;
matching brackets `` ( ) `` denote base pairs, dots ``.'' are used for
unconstrained bases. Constrained folding works by assigning bonus energies
to all structures that comply with the constraint.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun float energy_of_struct (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure})
calculates the energy of @var{sequence} on the @var{structure}
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   initialize_fold (int @var{length})
Obsolete function kept for backward compatibility.
Allocates memory for mfe folding sequences not longer than @var{length},
and sets up pairing matrix and energy parameters.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   free_arrays ()
frees the memory allocated by @code{fold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   update_fold_params ()
call this to recalculate the pair matrix and energy parameters after a
change in folding parameters like @code{temperature}
(@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables}).
@end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{fold.h}.

@node PF Fold, Inverse Fold, mfe Fold, Folding Routines
@section Partition Function Folding

Instead of the minimum free energy structure the partition function of
all possible structures and from that the pairing probability for every
possible pair can be calculated, using a dynamic programming algorithm
as described by @cite{McCaskill (1990)}. The  following
functions are provided:

@deftypefun float pf_fold (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure})
calculates the partition function @math{Z} of @var{sequence} and returns
the free energy of the ensemble @math{F} in kcal/mol, where @math{F=-kT
ln(Z)}. If @var{structure} is not a NULL pointer on input, it contains on
return a string consisting of the letters `` . , | @{ @} ( ) `` denoting
bases that are essentially unpaired, weakly paired, strongly paired without
preference, weakly upstream (downstream) paired, or strongly up-
(down-)stream paired bases, respectively.  If @code{fold_constrained}
(@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables}) is 1, the @var{structure} string is
interpreted on input as a list of constraints for the folding. The
character ``x`` marks bases that must be unpaired, matching brackets `` ( )
`` denote base pairs, all other characters are ignored. Any pairs
conflicting with the constraint will be forbidden. This usually sufficient
to ensure the constraints are honored.  If @code{do_backtrack} (@pxref{Fold
Vars,,Variables}) has been set to 0 base pairing probabilities will not
be computed (saving CPU time), otherwise the @code{pr[iindx[i]-j]}
(@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables}) will contain the probability that bases i
and j pair.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void init_pf_fold (int @var{length})
allocates memory for folding sequences not longer than @var{length};
sets up pairing matrix and energy parameters. Has to be called before
the first call to @code{pf_fold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void free_pf_arrays (void)
frees the memory allocated by @code{init_pf_fold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void update_pf_params (int @var{length})
Call this function to recalculate the pair matrix and energy parameters
after a change in folding parameters like temperature
(@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables}).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun double mean_bp_dist (int @var{length})
computes the mean base pair distance in the equilibrium ensemble as a
measure of the structural diversity.  It is given by @math{<d> =
sum_{a,b} p_a * p_b * d(a,b)}, where the sum goes over all pairs of
possible structure @math{a,b}, @math{p_a} is the Boltzmann weight of
structure @math{a}, and @math{d(a,b)} is the base pair distance (see
@code{bp_distance()} in @xref{Distances}.). The mean base pair distances
can be computed efficiently from the pair probabilities @math{p_ij} as
@math{<d> = sum_{ij} p_ij * (1-p_ij)}. Uses the global @code{pr} array
filled by a previous call to @code{pf_fold()}.
@end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{part_func.h}.

@node Inverse Fold, Suboptimal folding, PF Fold, Folding Routines
@section  Inverse Folding

We provide two functions that search for sequences with a given
structure, thereby inverting the folding routines.


@deftypefun float inverse_fold (char* @var{start}, char* @var{target})
searches for a sequence with minimum free energy structure
@var{target}, starting with sequence @var{start}. It returns 0 if the
search was successful, otherwise a structure distance to @var{target}
is returned. The found sequence is returned in @var{start}. If @code{give_up}
@vindex give_up
is set to 1, the function will return as soon as it is
clear that the search will be unsuccessful, this speeds up the algorithm
if you are only interested in exact solutions.
Since @code{inverse_fold()} calls @code{fold()} you have to allocate memory
for folding by calling @code{initialize_fold()}
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun float inverse_pf_fold (char* @var{start}, char* @var{target})
searches for a sequence with maximum probability to fold into structure
@var{target} using the partition function algorithm. It returns
-kT log(p) where p is the frequency of @var{target} in the ensemble of
possible structures. This is usually much slower than @code{inverse_fold()}.
Since @code{inverse_pf_fold()} calls @code{pf_fold()} you have to allocate
memory for folding by calling @code{init_pf_fold()}
@end deftypefun

@deftypevar char *symbolset
The global variable @code{char *symbolset} points to the allowed bases,
initially @code{"AUGC"}.  It can be used to design sequences from reduced
alphabets.
@end deftypevar

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{inverse.h}.

@node Suboptimal folding, Cofolding, Inverse Fold, Folding Routines
@section  Suboptimal folding

@deftp {data type} SOLUTION  struct @{float energy; char *structure;@}
@end deftp

@deftypefun SOLUTION* subopt (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{constraint}, int* @var{delta}, FILE* @var{fp})
poduces @strong{all} suboptimal secondary structures within
@var{delta}*0.01 kcal/mol of the optimum. The reults are either
directly written to a @var{fp} (if @var{fp} is not @code{NULL}), or
(@var{fp}@code{==NULL}) returned in a @code{SOLUTION *} list terminated
by an entry were the @code{structure} pointer is @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{subopt.h}.

@node Cofolding, Local Fold, Suboptimal folding, Folding Routines
@section  Predicting hybridization structures of two molecules

The function of an RNA molecule often depends on its interaction with
other RNAs. The following routines therefore allow to predict structures
formed by two RNA molecules upon hybridization.
One approach to co-folding two RNAs consists of concatenating the two
sequences and keeping track of the concatenation point in all energy
evaluations. Correspondingly, many of the @code{cofold()} and
@code{co_pf_fold()} routines below take one sequence string as argument
and use the the global variable @var{cut_point} to mark the concatenation
point. Note that while the @code{RNAcofold} program uses the '&' character
to mark the chain break in its input, you should not use an '&' when using
the library routines (set @var{cut_point} instead).

@deftypevar int cut_point
@code{cut_point} marks the position (starting from 1) of the first
nucleotide of the second molecule within the concatenated sequence.
The default value of -1 stands for single molecule folding. The
@code{cut_point} variable is also used by @code{PS_rna_plot()} and
@code{PS_dot_plot()} to mark the chain break in postscript plots.
@end deftypevar

@deftypefun float cofold (char @var{*sequence}, char @var{*structure})
The analog to the  @code{fold()} function. Computes the minimum free
energy of two RNA molecules interacting. If @code{cut_point==-1} results
should be the same as with @code{fold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun  void  free_co_arrays (void)
Frees arrays allocated by @code{cofold()}.
@end deftypefun

@c @deftypefun char *tokenize (char @var{*line})
@c Takes the sequence as it is taken from stdin or a file, sets the
@c @var{cut_point} global variable to the position of the '&' character
@c and cuts out the '&' character to return the sequence as it will be
@c used by all cofold functions.
@c @end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   initialize_cofold (int @var{length})
Allocates memory for mfe cofolding sequences not longer than @var{length},
and sets up pairing matrix and energy parameters.
Explicitely calling  @code{initialize_cofold()} is normally not necessary,
as it will be called automagically before folding.
@end deftypefun

@c @deftypefun extern struct plist *get_mfe_plist (struct plist @var{*pl})
@c This writes the global @var{*pr} array into the new structure
@c @var{plist}, creating an array of the base pairs of the minimum free
@c energy structure (and nothing else). Default probability is 0.95.
@c Used when @var{*pr} is going to be freed or overwritten by other
@c functions (e.g. @code{ co_pf_fold()},@code{cofold()}, etc).
@c @end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{cofold.h}.


@section  Partition Function Cofolding
As for folding one RNA molecule, this computes the partition function
of all possible structures and the base pair probabilities. Uses the
same global @var{pf_scale} variable to avoid overflows.

To simplify the implementation the partition function computation is done
internally in a null model that does not include the duplex initiation
energy, i.e. the entropic penalty for producing a dimer from two
monomers). The resulting free energies and pair probabilities are initally
relative to that null model. In a second step the free energies can be
corrected to include the dimerization penalty, and the pair probabilities
can be divided into the conditional pair probabilities given that a re
dimer is formed or not formed.


@deftp {data type} cofoldF  struct @{double F0AB, FAB, FcAB, FA, FB;@}
@end deftp

@deftypefun cofoldF co_pf_fold (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure})
The analog to the @code{pf_fold()} function, it computes the partition
function of two interacting RNA molecules as well as base pair
probabilities.
It returns a struct including free energies computed for different
models. F0AB is the free energy in the null model; FAB is corrected
to include the initiation penalty, FcAB only includes real dimers. FA and
FB are the free energies of the 2 molecules, resp. As with @code{cofold()}
the @var{cut_point} global variable has to be set to mark the chain break
between the molecules.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun void   free_co_pf_arrays (void)
frees partition function cofold arrays allocated in @code{ co_pf_fold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   init_co_pf_fold (int @var{length})
Obsolete function kept for backward compatibility.
Allocates memory for partition function cofolding sequences not longer
than @var{length}, and sets up pairing matrix and energy parameters.
@end deftypefun

@deftp {data type} plist  struct @{int i; int j; float energy;@}
@end deftp

@deftypefun extern struct plist *get_plist (struct plist @var{*pl}, int @var{length}, double @var{cut_off})
Makes a list of base pairs out of the global @var{*pr} array,
ignoring all base pairs with a probability less than @var{cut_off}. 
This is useful since the @var{pr} array gets overwritten by subsequent
foldings. 
@end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{co_part_func.h}.

@section  Cofolding all Dimeres, Concentrations
After computing the partition functions of all possible dimeres one
can compute the probabilities of base pairs, the concentrations out of
start concentrations and sofar and soaway.

@deftypefun void compute_probabilities (double @var{FAB}, double @var{FEA}, double @var{FEB}, struct plist  @var{*prAB}, struct plist  @var{*prA}, struct plist  @var{*prB}, int @var{Alength})
Given the pair probabilities and free energies (in the null model) for a
dimer AB and the two constituent monomers A and B, compute the conditional pair
probabilities given that a dimer AB actually forms.
Null model pair probabilities are given as a list as produced by
@code{get_plist()}), the dimer probabilities @var{prAB} are modified in
place.
@end deftypefun

Dimer formation is inherently concentration dependent. Given the free
energies of the monomers A and B and dimers AB, AA, and BB one can compute
the equilibrium concentrations, given input concentrations of A and B, see
e.g.~@cite{Dimitrov & Zuker (2004)}

@deftp {data type} ConcEnt  struct @{double A0; double B0;double ABc;double AAc; double BBc; double Ac; double Bc;@}
@end deftp

@deftypefun extern struct ConcEnt  *get_concentrations(double @var{FEAB}, double @var{FEAA}, double @var{FEBB}, double @var{FEA}, double @var{FEB}, double * @var{startconc})
Takes an array  @var{startconc} of input concentrations with alternating
entries for the initial concentrations of molecules A and B (terminated by
two zeroes), then computes the resulting equilibrium concentrations
from the free energies for the dimers. Dimer free energies should be the
dimer-only free energies, i.e. the FcAB entries from the @code{cofoldF} struct.
@end deftypefun

@c @deftypefun int make_probsum (int @var{length}, char @var{*name})
@c Computes the probability of any base to be paired to a base wtih a
@c number lower than @var{length} (used for e.g. compute probability to
@c be paired within one molecule).
@c @end deftypefun

Prototypes for these functions are declared in @file{co_part_func.h}.

@node Local Fold, Alignment Fold, Cofolding, Folding Routines
@section Searching for local mfe structures in large molecules

Local structures can be predicted by a modified version of the
@code{fold()} algorithm that restricts the span of all base pairs.

@deftypefun float  Lfold (char *@var{string}, char *@var{structure}, int @var{maxdist})
The local analog to @code{fold()}. Computes the minimum free energy
structure including only base pairs with a span smaller than
@end deftypefun

@var{maxdist}.

@deftypefun int pfl_fold (char *@var{sequence}, int @var{winSize}, float @var{cutoff}, struct plist **@var{pl})
pfl_fold computes partition functions for every window of size
@var{winSize} possible in a RNA molecule, and returns the mean base
pair probabilities in @var{pl}. Note that in contrast to @code{Lfold()}, bases outside
of the window do not influence the structure at all. Only
probabilities higher than @var{cutoff} are kept.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void  init_pf_foldLP (int @var{length})
Analog to @code{init_pf_fold()}. @var{length} is the length  of the sequence.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void  free_pf_arraysLP (void)
frees the arrays used by @code{pfl_fold()}
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void  update_pf_paramsLP (int @var{length})
Analog to @code{update_pf_params()}. @var{length} is the length  of the sequence.
@end deftypefun

@node Alignment Fold, Fold Vars, Local Fold, Folding Routines
@section   Predicting Consensus Structures from an Alignment

Consensus structures can be predicted by a modified version of the
@code{fold()} algorithm that takes a set of aligned sequences instead
of a single sequence. The energy function consists of the mean energy
averaged over the sequences, plus a covariance term that favors pairs
with consistent and compensatory mutations and penalizes pairs that
cannot be formed by all structures. For details see @cite{Hofacker (2002)}.

@deftypefun float alifold (char** @var{sequences}, char* @var{structure})
Predicts the consensus structure for the aligned @var{sequences}
and returns the minimum free energy; the mfe structure in bracket
notation (@pxref{notations}) is returned in @var{structure}.
Sufficient space must be allocated for @var{structure} before calling
@code{alifold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void free_alifold_arrays ()
frees the memory allocated by @code{alifold()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void update_alifold_params ()
call this to recalculate the pair matrix and energy parameters after a
change in folding parameters like @code{temperature}
(@pxref{Fold Vars,,Variables}).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun float alipf_fold (char** @var{sequences}, char* @var{structure}, pair_info **@var{pi})
The partition function version of @code{alifold()} works in analogy to
@code{pf_fold()}. Pair probabilities and information about sequence
covariations are returned via the @var{pi} variable as a list of
@code{pair_info} structs.  The list is terminated by the first entry with
@code{pi.i = 0}.
@end deftypefun

@deftp {data type} pair_info  struct @{short i,j; float p; float ent; short bp[8]; char comp;@}
for each base pair @code{i,j} the structure lists: its probability
@code{p}, an entropy-like measure for its well-definedness @code{ent},
and in @code{bp[]} the frequency of each type of pair. @code{bp[0]}
contains the number of non-compatible sequences, @code{bp[1]} the
number of CG pairs, etc.
@end deftp

@deftypevar double  cv_fact
@code{cv_fact} controls the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function. Default is 1.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar double nc_fact
controls the magnitude of the penalty for non-compatible sequences in
the covariance term. Default is 1.
@end deftypevar

@node Fold Vars, Param Files , Alignment Fold, Folding Routines
@section   Global Variables for the Folding Routines

The following global variables change the behavior the folding
algorithms or contain additional information after folding.

@deftypevar int  noGU
do not allow GU pairs if equal 1; default is 0.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int  no_closingGU
if 1 allow GU pairs only inside stacks, not as closing pairs;
default is 0.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int  noLonelyPairs
Disallow all pairs which can @strong{only} occur as lonely pairs (i.e. as helix
of length 1). This avoids lonely base pairs in the predicted structures in
most cases.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int  tetra_loop
include special stabilizing energies for some tetra loops; default is 1.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int  energy_set
if 1 or 2: fold sequences from an artificial alphabet ABCD..., where A
pairs B, C pairs D, etc. using either GC (1) or AU parameters (2);
default is 0, you probably don't want to change it.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar float temperature
rescale energy parameters to a temperature of @code{temperature} C.
Default is 37C. You have to call the update_@dots{}_params() functions after
changing this parameter.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int dangles
if set to 0 no stabilizing energies are assigned to bases adjacent to
helices in free ends and multiloops (so called dangling ends). Normally
(@code{dangles = 1}) dangling end energies are assigned only to unpaired
bases and a base cannot participate simultaneously in two dangling ends. In
the partition function algorithm @code{pf_fold()} these checks are neglected.
If @code{dangles} is set to 2, the @code{fold()} and
@code{energy_of_struct()} function will also follow this convention. This
treatment of dangling ends gives more favorable energies to helices
directly adjacent to one another, which can be beneficial since such
helices often do engage in stabilizing interactions through co-axial
stacking.@*
If @code{dangles = 3} co-axial stacking is explicitly included for
adjacent helices in mutli-loops. The option affects only mfe folding
and energy evaluation (@code{fold()} and @code{energy_of_struct()}), as
well as suboptimal folding (@code{subopt()}) via re-evaluation of energies.
Co-axial stacking with one intervening mismatch is not considered so far.

Default is 1, @code{pf_fold()} treats 1 as 2.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar char* nonstandards
Lists additional base pairs that will be allowed to form in addition to
GC, CG, AU, UA, GU and UG. Nonstandard base pairs are given a stacking
energy of 0.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int cut_point
To evaluate the energy of a duplex structure (a structure formed by two
strands), concatenate the to sequences and set @var{cut_point} to the
first base of the second strand in the concatenated sequence. Reset to
0 or -1 (the default) to evaluate normal single sequence structures.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar {struct bond @{ int i,j;@}} base_pair
Contains a list of base pairs after a call to @code{fold()}.
@code{base_pair[0].i} contains the total number of pairs.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar double* pr
contains the base pair probability matrix after a call to @code{pf_fold()}.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int* iindx
index array to move through pr. The probability for base i and j to form
a pair is in @code{pr[iindx[i]-j]}.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar float  pf_scale
a scaling factor used by @code{pf_fold()} to avoid overflows. Should be set
to approximately exp@math{((-F/kT)/length)}, where @math{F} is an estimate
for the ensemble free energy, for example the minimum free energy. You must
call @code{update_pf_params()} or @code{init_pf_fold()} after changing this
parameter. If pf_scale is -1 (the default) , an estimate will be provided
automatically when calling @code{init_pf_fold()} or
@code{update_f_params()}. The automatic estimate is usually insufficient
for sequences more than a few hundred bases long.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int    fold_constrained
If 1, calculate constrained minimum free energy structures. @xref{mfe Fold},
for more information. Default is 0;
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int    do_backtrack
if 0, do not calculate pair probabilities in @code{pf_fold()}; this is about
twice as fast. Default is 1.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar char backtrack_type
only for use by @code{inverse_fold()}; 'C': force (1,N) to be paired,
'M' fold as if the sequence were inside a multi-loop. Otherwise the
usual mfe structure is computed.
@end deftypevar

include @file{fold_vars.h} if you want to change any of these variables
from their defaults.

@node Param Files, , Fold Vars, Folding Routines
@section Energy Parameter Files

A default set of parameters, identical to the one described in @cite{Mathews
et.al. (1999)}, is compiled into the library.
Alternately, parameters can be read from and written to a file.

@deftypefun void read_parameter_file (const char @var{fname}[])
reads energy parameters from file @var{fname}. See below for the format of
the parameter file.
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun void write_parameter_file (const char @var{fname}[])
writes current energy parameters to the file @var{fname}.
@end deftypefun

The following describes the file format expected by
@code{read_parameter_file()}. All energies should be given as integers in
units of 0.01kcal/mol.

Various loop parameters depend in general on the pairs closing the loops,
as well as unpaired bases in the loops. Internally, the library
distinguishes 8 types of pairs (CG=1, GC=2, GU=3, UG=4, AU=5, UA=6,
nonstandard=7, 0= no pair), and 5 types of bases (A=1, C=2, G=3, U=4 and 0
for anything else). Parameters belonging to pairs of type 0 are not listed
in the parameter files, but values for nonstandard pairs (type 7) and
nonstandard bases (type 0) are. Thus, a table for symmetric size 2 interior
loops would have 7*7*5*5 entries (2 pairs, two unpaired bases).

The order of entries always uses the closing pair or pairs as the first
indices followed by the unpaired bases in 5' to 3' direction.  To determine
the type of a pair consider the base at the (local) 5' end of each strand
first, i.e. use the pairs @math{(i,j)} and @math{(q,p)} for an interior
loop with @math{i<p<q<j}. This is probably better explained by an example.
Consider the symmetric size 4 interior loop
@example
		      5'-GAUA-3'
		      3'-CGCU-5'
@end example
the first pair is GC, the second UA (not AU!) the unpaired bases are (in 5'
to 3' direction, starting at the first pair) A U C G. Thus we need entry
[2,6,1,4,2,3] of the corresponding table. Because the loop is
symmetric you could equally well describe it by UA GC C G A U, i.e. entry
[6,2,2,3,1,4]. Be careful to preserve this symmetry when editing
parameter tables!


@need 1000
The first line of the file should read
@*@t{## RNAfold parameter file}

@noindent lines of the form@*
@noindent @t{# token}@*
mark the beginning of a list of energy parameters of the type specified by
token. The following tokens are recognized:

@noindent @t{# stack_energies}@*
The list of free energies for stacked pairs, indexed by the two closing
pairs. The list should be formated as symmetric an 7*7 matrix,conforming
to the order explained above. As an example the stacked pair
@example
		      5'-GU-3'        5'-AC-3'
		      3'-CA-5'        3'-UG-5'
@end example
@noindent corresponds to the entry [2,5], which should be identical to [5,2].
Note that the format has changed from previous releases, to make it
consistent with other loop parameters.

@noindent @t{# stack_enthalpies}@*
enthalpies for stacked pairs, used to rescale stacking energies to
temperatures other than 37C. Same format as stack_energies.

@noindent @t{# hairpin}@*
Free energies of hairpin loops as a function of size. The list should
contain 31 entries on one or more lines. Since the minimum size of a
hairpin loop is 3 and we start counting with 0, the first three values
should be INF to indicate a forbidden value.

@noindent @t{# bulge}@*
Free energies of bulge loops. Should contain 31 entries, the first one
being INF.

@noindent @t{# internal_loop}@*
Free energies of internal loops. Should contain 31 entries, the first 4
being INF (since smaller loops are tabulated).

@noindent @t{# mismatch_interior}@*
Free energies for the interaction between the closing pair of an interior
loop and the two unpaired bases adjacent to the helix. This is a three
dimensional array indexed by the type of the closing pair (see above) and
the two unpaired bases. Since we distinguish 5 bases the list contains
7*5*5 entries and should be formated either as an 7*25 matrix or 7 5*5
matrices. The order is such that for example the mismatch
@example
			       5'-CU-3'
			       3'-GC-5'
@end example
@noindent corresponds to entry [1,4,2] (CG=1, U=4, C=2), (in this notation
the first index runs from 1 to 7, second and third from 0 to 4)

@noindent @t{# mismatch_hairpin}@*
Same as above for hairpin loops.

@noindent @t{# mismatch_enthalpies}@*
Corresponding enthalpies for rescaling to temperatures other than 37C.

@noindent @t{# int11_energies}@*
Free energies for symmetric size 2 interior loops. 7*7*5*5 entries formated
as 49 5*5 matrices, or seven 7*25 matrices. Example:
@example
			       5'-CUU-3'
			       3'-GCA-5'
@end example
corresponds to entry [1,5,4,2], which should be identical to [5,1,2,4].

@noindent @t{# int21_energies}@*
Free energies for size 3 (2+1) interior loops. 7*7*5*5*5 entries formated
in 5*5 or 5*25 matrices. The strand with a single unpaired base is listed
first, example:
@example
			       5'-CU U-3'
			       3'-GCCA-5'
@end example
corresponds to entry [1,5,4,2,2].

@noindent @t{# int22_energies}@*
Free energies for symmetric size 4 interior loops. To reduce the size of
parameter files this table only lists canonical bases (A,C,G,U) resulting in
a 7*7*4*4*4*4 table. See above for an example.

@noindent @t{# dangle5}@*
Energies for the interaction of an unpaired base on the 5' side and
adjacent to a helix in multiloops and free ends (the equivalent of mismatch
energies in interior and hairpin loops). The array is indexed by the type
of pair closing the helix and the unpaired base and, therefore, forms a 8*5
matrix. For example the dangling base in
@example
			       5'-GC-3'
			       3'- G-5'
@end example
@noindent corresponds to entry [1,2] (CG=1, C=2);

@noindent @t{# dangle3}@*
Same as above for bases on the 3' side of a helix.
@example
			       5'- A-3'
			       3'-AU-5'
@end example
@noindent corresponds to entry [5,1] (AU=5, A=1);

@noindent @t{# ML_params}@*
For the energy of a multi-loop a function of the form
@code{E = cu*n_unpaired + ci*loop_degree + cc}
is used where n_unpaired is the number of unpaired bases in the loop and
loop_degree is the number of helices forming the loop. In addition a
``terminal AU'' penalty is applied to AU and GU pairs in the loop.
The line following the token should contain these four values, in the order
@code{cu cc ci termAU}. The terminal AU penalty is also used for the
exterior loop and size 3 hairpins, for other loop types it is already
included in the mismatch energies.

@noindent @t{# Tetraloops}@*
Some tetraloops particularly stable tetraloops are assigned an energy
bonus. Up to forty tetraloops and their bonus energies can be listed
following the token, one sequence per line. For example:
@example
       GAAA    -200
@end example
@noindent assigns a bonus energy of -2 kcal/mol to tetraloops containing
the sequence GAAA.

@noindent @t{# END}@*
Anything beyond this token will be ignored.

A parameter file need not be complete, it might may contain only a subset
of interaction parameters, such as only stacking energies. However, for
each type of interaction listed, all entries have to be present.
A @samp{*} may be used to indicate entries of a list that are to retain
their default value. For loop energies a @samp{x} may be used to indicate that
the value is to be extrapolated from the values for smaller loop sizes.
Parameter files may contain C-style comments, i.e. any text between
@code{/*} and @code{*/} will be ignored. However, you may have no more
than one comment per line and no multi-line comments.

A parameter file listing the default parameter set should accompany your
distribution as @file{default.par}, the file @file{old.par} contains
parameters used in version 1.1b of the Package.

@section Representations of Secondary Structures

The standard representation of a secondary structure is the ``bracket
notation'', where matching brackets symbolize base pairs and unpaired
bases are shown as dots. Alternatively, one may use two types of node
labels, 'P' for paired and 'U' for unpaired; a dot is then replaced by
'(U)', and each closed bracket is assigned an additional identifier 'P'.
We call this the expanded notation. In @cite{Fontana et al. (1993)} a
condensed
representation of the secondary structure is proposed, the so-called
homeomorphically irreducible tree (HIT) representation. Here a stack is
represented as a single pair of matching brackets labeled 'P' and
weighted by the number of base pairs.  Correspondingly, a contiguous
strain of unpaired bases is shown as one pair of matching brackets
labeled 'U' and weighted by its length.  Generally any string consisting
of matching brackets and identifiers is equivalent to a plane tree with
as many different types of nodes as there are identifiers.

@cite{Bruce Shapiro (1988)} proposed a coarse grained representation, which,
does not retain the full information of the secondary structure. He
represents the different structure elements by single matching brackets
and labels them as 'H' (hairpin loop), 'I' (interior loop), 'B'
(bulge), 'M' (multi-loop), and 'S' (stack). We extend his alphabet by an
extra letter for external elements 'E'. Again these identifiers may be
followed by a weight corresponding to the number of unpaired bases or
base pairs in the structure element.  All tree representations (except
for the dot-bracket form) can be encapsulated into a virtual root
(labeled 'R'), see the example below.

The following example illustrates the different linear tree representations
used by the package. All lines show the same secondary structure.

@example
a) .((((..(((...)))..((..)))).)).
   (U)(((((U)(U)((((U)(U)(U)P)P)P)(U)(U)(((U)(U)P)P)P)P)(U)P)P)(U)
b) (U)(((U2)((U3)P3)(U2)((U2)P2)P2)(U)P2)(U)
c) (((H)(H)M)B)
   ((((((H)S)((H)S)M)S)B)S)
   (((((((H)S)((H)S)M)S)B)S)E)
d) ((((((((H3)S3)((H2)S2)M4)S2)B1)S2)E2)R)
@end example

Above: Tree representations of secondary structures.  a) Full structure:
the first line shows the more convenient condensed notation which is
used by our programs; the second line shows the rather clumsy expanded
notation for completeness, b) HIT structure, c) different versions of
coarse grained structures: the second line is exactly Shapiro's
representation, the first line is obtained by neglecting the stems.
Since each loop is closed by a unique stem, these two lines are
equivalent.  The third line is an extension taking into account also the
external digits.  d) weighted coarse structure, this time including the
virtual root.

For the output of aligned structures from string editing, different
representations are needed, where we put the label on both sides.
The above examples for tree representations would then look like:

@example
a) (UU)(P(P(P(P(UU)(UU)(P(P(P(UU)(UU)(UU)P)P)P)(UU)(UU)(P(P(UU)(U...
b) (UU)(P2(P2(U2U2)(P2(U3U3)P3)(U2U2)(P2(U2U2)P2)P2)(UU)P2)(UU)
c) (B(M(HH)(HH)M)B)
   (S(B(S(M(S(HH)S)(S(HH)S)M)S)B)S)
   (E(S(B(S(M(S(HH)S)(S(HH)S)M)S)B)S)E)
d) (R(E2(S2(B1(S2(M4(S3(H3)S3)((H2)S2)M4)S2)B1)S2)E2)R)
@end example

Aligned structures additionally contain the gap character '_'.

@section Distance Measures

* Profile Distances::           Comparing Pair probability Matrices
@end menu

A simple measure of dissimilarity between secondary structures of equal
length is the base pair distance, given by the number of pairs present in
only one of the two structures being compared. I.e. the number of base
pairs that have to be opened or closed to transform one structure into the
other. It is therefore particularly useful for comparing structures on the
same sequence. It is implemented by

@deftypefun int bp_distance (char* @var{s1}, char* @var{s2})
returns the ``base pair'' distance between two secondary structures @var{s1}
and @var{s2}, which should have the same length.
@end deftypefun

For other cases a distance measure that allows for gaps is preferable.
We can define distances between structures as edit distances between
trees or their string representations. In the case of string distances
this is the same as ``sequence alignment''. Given a set of edit operations
and edit costs, the edit distance is given by the minimum sum of the
costs along an edit path converting one object into the other. Edit
distances like these always define a metric. The edit operations used by us
are insertion, deletion and replacement of nodes.
String editing does not pay attention to the matching of brackets, while
in tree editing matching brackets represent a single node of the tree.
Tree editing is therefore usually preferable, although somewhat
slower. String edit distances are always smaller or equal to tree edit
distances.

The different level of detail in the structure representations defined
above naturally leads to different measures of distance. For full
structures we use a cost of 1 for deletion or insertion of an unpaired
base and 2 for a base pair. Replacing an unpaired base for a pair incurs
a cost of 1.

Two cost matrices are provided for coarse grained structures:

@example
/*  Null,   H,   B,   I,   M,   S,   E     */
   @{   0,   2,   2,   2,   2,   1,   1@},   /* Null replaced */
   @{   2,   0,   2,   2,   2, INF, INF@},   /* H    replaced */
   @{   2,   2,   0,   1,   2, INF, INF@},   /* B    replaced */
   @{   2,   2,   1,   0,   2, INF, INF@},   /* I    replaced */
   @{   2,   2,   2,   2,   0, INF, INF@},   /* M    replaced */
   @{   1, INF, INF, INF, INF,   0, INF@},   /* S    replaced */
   @{   1, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF,   0@},   /* E    replaced */


/*  Null,   H,   B,   I,   M,   S,   E    */
   @{   0, 100,   5,   5,  75,   5,   5@},   /* Null replaced */
   @{ 100,   0,   8,   8,   8, INF, INF@},   /* H    replaced */
   @{   5,   8,   0,   3,   8, INF, INF@},   /* B    replaced */
   @{   5,   8,   3,   0,   8, INF, INF@},   /* I    replaced */
   @{  75,   8,   8,   8,   0, INF, INF@},   /* M    replaced */
   @{   5, INF, INF, INF, INF,   0, INF@},   /* S    replaced */
   @{   5, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF,   0@},   /* E    replaced */
@end example

The lower matrix uses the costs given in @cite{Shapiro (1990)}.
All distance functions use the following global variables:


@deftypevar int   cost_matrix
if 0, use the default cost matrix (upper matrix in example); otherwise
use Shapiro's costs (lower matrix).
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int   edit_backtrack
produce an alignment of the two structures being compared by
tracing the editing path giving the minimum distance.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar char* aligned_line[2]

functions with

@node Utilities, Example, Parsing and Comparing, Top
@chapter Utilities

The following utilities are used and therefore provided by the library:

@deftypefun int PS_dot_plot (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{filename})
reads base pair probabilities produced by @code{pf_fold()} from the
global array @code{pr} and the pair list @code{base_pair} produced by
@code{fold()} and produces a postscript ``dot plot'' that is written to
@var{filename}. The ``dot plot'' represents each base pairing
probability by a square of corresponding area in a upper triangle
matrix. The lower part of the matrix contains the minimum free energy
structure.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int PS_rna_plot (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure}, char* @var{filename})
produces a secondary structure graph in PostScript and writes it to
@var{filename}. Note that this function has changed from previous versions
and now expects the structure to be plotted in dot-bracket notation as an
argument. It does not make use of the global @code{base_pair} array anymore.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int PS_rna_plot_a (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure}, char* @var{filename}, char* @var{pre}, char* @var{post})
Same as @code{PS_rna_plot} but adds extra PostScript macros for various
annotations (see generated PS code). The @var{pre} and @var{post}
variables contain PostScript code that is verbatim copied in the
resulting PS file just before and after the structure plot.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int svg_RNA_plot (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure}, char* @var{filename})
produces a secondary structure plot in SVG format and writes it to
@var{filename}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gmlRNA (char* @var{sequence}, char* @var{structure}, char* @var{filename}, char @var{option})
produces a secondary structure graph in the Graph Meta Language gml and
writes it to @var{filename}. If @code{option} is an uppercase letter the
@code{sequence} is used to label nodes, if @code{option} equals @kbd{'X'}
or @kbd{'x'} the resulting file will coordinates for an initial layout of
the graph.
@end deftypefun

@deftypevar int rna_plot_type
switches between different layout algorithms for drawing secondary
structures in @code{PS_rna_plot} and @code{gmlRNA}. Current possibility are
0 for a simple radial drawing or 1 for the modified radial drawing taken from
the @code{naview} program of @cite{Bruccoleri & Heinrich (1988)}.
@end deftypevar

@deftypefun char* random_string (int @var{l}, char* @var{symbols})
generates a ``random'' string of characters from @var{symbols} with
length @var{l}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int    hamming (char* @var{s1}, char* @var{s2})
returns the number of positions in which @var{s1} and @var{s2} differ,
the so called ``Hamming'' distance. @var{s1} and @var{s2} should have the
same length.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {unsigned char*} pack_structure (char* @var{struc})
returns a binary string encoding the secondary structure @var{struc}
using a 5:1 compression scheme. The string is NULL terminated and can
therefore be used with standard string functions such as strcmp().
Useful for programs that need to keep many structures in memory.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun char*  unpack_structure (unsigned char* @var{packed})
translate a compressed binary string produced by pack_structure() back into
the familiar dot bracket notation.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun short* make_pair_table (char* @var{structure})
returns a newly allocated table, such that:  table[i]=j if (i.j) pair or 0
if i is unpaired, table[0] contains the length of the @var{structure}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun char* time_stamp (void)
returns a string containing the current date in the format
``Fri Mar 19 21:10:57 1993''.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void   nrerror (char* @var{message})
writes @var{message} to stderr and aborts the program.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun double urn ()
returns a pseudo random number in the range [0..1[, usually implemented
by calling @code{erand48()}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypevar {unsigned short} xsubi[3]
is used by @code{urn ()}. These should be set to some random number seeds
before the first call to @code{urn ()}.
@end deftypevar

@deftypefun int    int_urn (int @var{from}, int @var{to})
generates a pseudo random integer in the range [@var{from}, @var{to}].
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void* space (unsigned int @var{size})
returns a pointer to @var{size} bytes of allocated and 0 initialized
memory; aborts with an error if memory is not available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun char* get_line (FILE* @var{fp})
reads a line of arbitrary length from the stream @var{*fp}, and returns
a pointer to the resulting string. The necessary memory is allocated and
should be released using @code{free()} when the string is no longer needed.

In a typical Unix environment you would compile this program using:
@kbd{cc -c example.c -I@var{hpath}}
and link using
@kbd{cc -o example -L@var{lpath} -lRNA -lm}
where @var{hpath} and @var{lpath} point to the location of the header
files and library, respectively.
