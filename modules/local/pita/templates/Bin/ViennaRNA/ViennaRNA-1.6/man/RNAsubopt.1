RNAsubopt \- calculate suboptimal secondary structures of RNAs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRNAsubopt [\-e\ \fIrange\fP] [\-ep \fIprange\fP] [\-s] [\-p\ \fIn\fP] [\-T\ \fItemp\fP] [\-d[0|1|2|3]] [\-4] [\-noGU] [\-noCloseGU] [\-P\ paramfile] [\-logML] [\-nsp\ pairs]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAsubopt 
reads RNA sequences from stdin and calculates all suboptimal secondary
structures within a user defined energy range above the minimum free
energy (mfe). It prints the suboptimal structures in bracket notation
followed by the energy in kcal/mol to stdout.
Be careful, the number of structures returned grows exponentially with both 
sequence length and energy range.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-e\ \fIrange\fP
Calculate suboptimal structures within \fIrange\fP kcal/mol of the mfe. 
Default is 1.
.TP 
.B \-s
Sort the structures by energy. Since the sort in is done in memory,
this becomes impractical when the number of structures produced goes
into millions. In such cases better pipe the output through `sort +1n'. 
.TP 
.B \-p \fIn\fP
Instead of producing all suboptimals in a range, produce a random sample 
of \fIn\fP suboptimal structures, drawn with probabilities equal to
their Boltzmann weights via stochastic backtracking in the partition
function. 
.TP 
.B \-d[0|1|2|3]
Change treatment of dangling ends, as in RNAfold and RNAeval.  The
default is \-d2 (as in partition function folding). If \-d1 or \-d3 are
specified the structures are generated as with \-d2 but energies are
re\-evaluated before printing.
.TP 
.B \-logML
re\-calculate energies of structures using a logarithmic energy function for
multi\-loops before output. This option does not effect structure
generation, only the energies that is printed out. Since logML lowers
energies somewhat, some structures may be missing.
.TP 
.B \-ep \fIprange\fP
Only print structures with energy within \fIprange\fR of the mfe. Useful in
conjunction with \-logML, \-d1 or \-d3: while the \-e option specifies the
range before energies are re\-evaluated, \-ep specifies the maximum energy
after re\-evaluation.
.TP 
.B \-noLP
Only produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). This
reduces the number of structures drastically and should therefore be used
for longer sequences and larger energy ranges.
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP, 
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in RNAfold.
