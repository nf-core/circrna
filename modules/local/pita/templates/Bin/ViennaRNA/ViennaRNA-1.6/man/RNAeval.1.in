.SH "NAME"
RNAEVAL \- calculate energy of RNA sequences on given secondary structure
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRNAeval [\-T \fItemp\fP] [\-4] [\-d[0|1|2|3]] [\-logML] [\-e \fI1|2\fP] [\-P \fIparamfile\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAeval
evaluates the free energy of an RNA molecule in fixed secondary
structure. Sequences and structures are read alternately from stdin. 
The energy in Kcal/Mol is written to stdout.
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences and structures until a
line consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition
is encountered.
.br 
If the input sequence or structure contains the separator character "&" the
program calculates the energy of the co\-folding of two RNA strands, where
the "&" marks the boundary between the two strands.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-d\fB
Do not give stabilizing energies to unpaired bases adjacent to helices in
multiloops and free ends ("dangling ends"). Same as \-d0, opposite of \-d1
(the default).
.IP \fB\-d2\fB
Treat dangling ends as in the partition function algorithm, i.e. bases
adjacent to helices in multiloops and free ends give a stabilizing energy
contribution, regardless whether they're paired or unpaired.
.IP \fB\-d3\fB
Allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in multi\-loops.
.IP \fB\-logML\fB
Let multiloop energies depend logarithmically on the size, instead of the
usual linear energy function.
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, options work as in RNAfold.
