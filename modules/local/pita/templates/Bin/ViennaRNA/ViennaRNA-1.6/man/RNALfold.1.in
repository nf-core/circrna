RNALfold \- calculate locally stable secondary structures of RNAs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRNALfold\fP [\-L span] [\-T\ \fItemp\fP] [\-4] [\-noLP] [\-noGU] [\-noCloseGU] [\-e\ \fI1|2\fP] [\-P\ \fIparamfile\fP] [\-nsp\ \fIpairs\fP] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNALfold
computes locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair
span. For a sequence of length n and a base pair span of L the
algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is
practical to "scan" very large genomes for short RNA structures.

Output consists of a list of secondary structure components of size <=
L, one entry per line. Each output line contains the predicted local
structure its energy in kcal/mol and the starting position of the
local structure.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-L span
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base pair to span. I.e. no
pairs (i,j) with j\-i>span will be allowed. 
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in
RNAfold. Most tests were done using "\-d2 \-noLP", other dangling end
settings may still be buggy.
