RNAduplex \- Compute the structure upon hybridization of two RNA strands

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fIRNAduplex\fR reads two RNA sequences from stdin or \fI<filename>\fR and computes optimal and suboptimal secondary structures for their hybridization. The calculation is simplified by allowing only inter\-molecular base pairs, for the general case use \fBRNAcofold\fR. 
.LP 
The computed optimal and suboptimal structure are written to stdout, one structure per line.
Each line consist of: The structure in dot bracket format with a "&" separating the two strands. The range of the structure in the two sequences in the format  "from,to : from,to"; the energy of duplex structure in kcal/mol.
.br 
The format is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure between a small probe sequence and a long target sequence.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-e\fR \fIrange\fR 
Compute suboptimal structures with energy with \fIrange\fR kcal/mol of the optimum.
Default is calculation of mfe structure only.
.PP 
For the standard options, such as 
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-4\fR, \fB\-noGU\fR, \-\fBnoCloseGU\fR,
\fB\-P\fR see the \fBRNAfold\fR man page.
