RNAplot \- Draw RNA Secondary Structures
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRNAplot [\-t\ \fI0|1\fP] [\-o\ \fIps|gml|xrna|svg\fP] 
[\-\-pre\ \fIstring\fP] [\-\-post \fIstring\fP] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAplot
reads RNA sequences and structures from stdin in the format as produced by
RNAfold and produces drawings of the secondary structure graph.
The coordinates are produced using either E. Bruccoleri's naview routines,
or a simple radial layout method.

If the sequence was preceded by a line of the form
.br 
> name
.br 
the output file will be named "name_ss.ps" otherwise "rna.ps" is used. 
Existing files of the same name will be overwritten.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-t\ \fI0|1\fP
Choose the layout algorithm. Simple radial layout if 0, or naview if 1.
Default is 1.
.TP 
.B \-o\ \fIps|gml|xrna|svg\fP
Specify output format. Available formats are: PostScript (ps), Graph
Meta Language (gml), Scalable Vector Graphics (svg), and XRNA save file
(xrna). Output filenames will end in ".ps" ".gml" ".svg" ".ss",
respectively. Default is ps.
.TP 
.B \-\-pre \fIstring\fP   \-\-post \fIstring\fP
Add annotation macros to postscript file, and add the postscript code
in "string" just before (\-\-pre) or after (\-\-post) the code to draw the
structure. This is an easy way to add annotation, e.g to mark position
15 with circle use \-\-post "15 cmark"
