.SH "NAME"
RNAheat \- calculate specific heat of RNAs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRNAheat [\-Tmin \fIt1\fP] [\-Tmax \fIt2\fP] [\-h \fIstepsize\fP] [\-m
\fIipoints\fP] [\-d] [\-4] [\-noGU] [\-noCloseGU] [\-nsp pairs] [\-P paramfile] [\-e \fI1|2\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAheat
reads RNA sequences from stdin and calculates their specific heat
in the temperature range \fIt1\fP to \fIt2\fP, from the partition
function by numeric differentiation. The result is written to stdout
as a list of pairs of temperature in C and specific heat in Kcal/(Mol*K).
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character "@" or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-Tmin\ \fIt1\fP
Lowest temperature, default is 0C.
.IP \fB\-Tmax\ \fIt2\fP
Highest temperature, default is 100C.
.IP \fB\-h\ \fIstepsize\fP
Calculate partition function every \fIstepsize\fP degrees C. Default
is 1C.
.IP \fB\-m\ \fIipoints\fP
The program fits a parabola to 2*ipoints+1 data points to calculate
2nd derivatives. Increasing this parameter produces a smoother curve.
Default is 2.
.PP 
The \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP, \fB\-e\fP,
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in RNAfold.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.nf 
	RNAheat \-Tmin \-30 \-Tmax 120 \-h 0.1 \-m 4 < tRNA.seq | xmgrace \-pipe
.nf 
produces plots of the specific heat of the sequences in tRNA.seq.
.SH "REFERENCES"
The partition function algorithm is based on work by J.S. McCaskill.
