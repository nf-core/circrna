The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
Vienna RNA package (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/).

RNAforester supports the following functionality:
- calculate a global alignment of RNA secondary structures
- calculate a local alignments (local similarity) of RNA secondary structures
- calculate multiple alignments of RNA secondary structures
- visualize RNA secondary structure alignments as 2d plots

The package should be easily portable. It is known to compile without
modifications at least under SunOS 8.x, and linux.
Other UN*X flavours should present no problems.
You need a compiler that understands standard C++.
See the INSTALL file for details.

For more details about RNAforester information see the man page.
