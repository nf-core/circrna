The code for computing a maximum wheigted matching was written by Ed Rothberg
and implements H. Gabow's N-cubed weighted matching algorithm, 
as described in his Ph.D. thesis
"Implementation of Algorithms for Maximum Matching on Nonbipartite Graphs" 
Stanford University, 1973.  
(refer to http://elib.zib.de/pub/Packages/mathprog/matching/weighted/)

The prediction of structures utilizes functions from the Vienna 
RNA library, originally described in:
Fast Folding and Comparison of RNA Secondary Structures,
Ivo L. Hofacker, Walter Fontana, Peter F. Stadler, L. Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Manfred Tacker, and Peter Schuster
Appeared in: Monatsh.Chem. 125: 167-188 (1994).
