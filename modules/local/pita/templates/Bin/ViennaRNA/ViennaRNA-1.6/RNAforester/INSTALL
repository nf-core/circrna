Installation:

This package uses GNU autoconf generated configure scripts, see the
file INSTALL.configure for generic configure documentation.

Requirements: 
----------

You must have the g2 - graphic library V0.49a (C) 1999 Lj. Milanovic, H. Wagner
installed on your system. If not the g2 graphics library
is ditributed with RNAforester by the file g2-0.49a.tar.gz. 

If g2 is installed usually you'll just have to type:
        ./configure
        make
and (as root)
        make install

The Vienna RNA lib (libRNA) (C) I. Hofacker must be installed on your system.
Refer to http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ for download and further 
instructions.

Quickstart for users that do not have administrator rights
----------------------------------------------------------

Say your home directory is /home/user.
If the g2 library is not installed on your system you'll have to type:

tar xvzf g2-0.49a.tar.gz
cd g2-0.49a
./configure --prefix=/home/user
make
make install
cd ..

Make sure the Vienna RNA package is installed on your system.

To install RNAforester type:

./configure --prefix=/home/user
make
make install

If the includes files of the g2 library cannot be found you can add
the path including the headers as follows:
CPPFLAGS=-I/home/user/include ./configure --prefix=/home/user
(of course, your include path can differ)

Installation Paths:
-------------
The main programs, library and man are
installed in the usual places by default
(i.e. /usr/local/{bin,lib,man}).

All these locations can be changed by calling ./configure with
appropriate options.


Microsoft Visual C++
-----------------------

RNAforester uses the getline function of STL. There is a bug in some VC versions
in this function. If you must hit the return key twice to confirm your input,
 open file <string> and change the code as indicated by the comment:

    else if (_Tr::eq(_C, _D))
        {_Chg = true;
        _I.rdbuf()->snextc();    // replace snextc with sbumpc
        break; }
