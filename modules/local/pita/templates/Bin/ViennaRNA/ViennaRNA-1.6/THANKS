Sebastian Bonhoeffer's implementation of partition function folding served
	  as a precursor to our part_func.c
Manfred Tacker hacked constrained folding into fold.c for the first time
Martin Fekete made the first attempts at "alignment folding"

Thanks also to everyone who helped testing and finding bugs, especially
Christoph Flamm, Martijn Huynen, Baerbel Krakhofer, and many more
